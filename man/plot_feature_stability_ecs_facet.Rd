\title{Feature Stability - ECC facet}
\usage{
plot_feature_stability_ecs_facet(
  feature_object_list,
  n_facet_cols = 3,
  point_size = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_object_list}{An object or a concatenation of objects returned by the
`get_feature_stability_object` method}

\item{n_facet_cols}{The number of facet's columns.}

\item{point_size}{The size of the points displayed on the plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot facet object
}
\description{
Display a facet of plots where each graph is associated with a step of
a feature set and illustrates the distribution of the ECC score over the UMAP
embedding.
