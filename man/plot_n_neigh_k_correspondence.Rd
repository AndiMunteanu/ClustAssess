\title{Relationship Between Number of Nearest Neighbors and Number of Clusters}
\usage{
plot_n_neigh_k_correspondence(nn_object_n_clusters)
}
\arguments{
\item{nn_object_n_clusters}{An object or a concatenation of objects returned by the
`get_nn_importance` method.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object with the distributions displayed as boxplots.
}
\description{
Display the distribution of the
number of clusters obtained for each number of neighbors across random seeds.
}
\note{
The number of clusters is displayed on a logarithmic scale.
}
