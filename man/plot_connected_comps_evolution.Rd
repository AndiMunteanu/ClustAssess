\name{plot_connected_comps_evolution}
\alias{plot_connected_comps_evolution}
\title{Graphical representation of the link between NN and graph connectivity}
\usage{
plot_connected_comps_evolution(nn_conn_comps_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{nn_conn_comps_object}{An object or a concatenation of objects returned by the
`get_nn_conn_comps` method.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Display, for each number of neighbors, the distribution of the
number connected components obtained at different seeds. The distribution is
displayed as a boxplot.
}
\note{
The number of connected components is displayed on a logarithmic scale.
}
\examples{
# the graph reduction type is PCA, so we can provide the expression matrix as argument
nn_conn_comps_obj = get_nn_conn_comps(object = as.matrix(mtcars),
    n_neigh_sequence = c(2,5,15),
    config_name = "mt_cars",
    n_repetitions = 1,
    graph_reduction_type = "PCA",
    transpose = FALSE,
    # the following parameter is used by the irlba function and is not mandatory
    nv = 4)
